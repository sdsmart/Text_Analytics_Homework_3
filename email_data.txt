Hello,

I work for the Sam Noble Museum writing and coordinating scout programs. On the afternoon of October 4, we will hold a workshop for 6 to 24 girls aged 9-11. One requirement of their badge is to explore video game development.

Do you have a student, professor, or contact in the field of video game development that would be willing to speak with the girl scouts?

The discussion could last between 30 and 45 minutes in the afternoon of Saturday, October 4th between 1:30 and 3:50. The discussion would be about the creative process, the steps of creating a game, and sharing their portfolio or latest creation.

Thank you,

Sarah Novak

Message-ID: <5408E4CC.5080708@gmail.com>

Dear Madam/Sir,

I have some questions about application. I found the deadline 
information on website says for international applications,  Sep 1st is 
the last day for Spring semester. Currently, I'm a graduate student in 
microbiology at OU. I was wondering whether I could be considered as 
applicant in the US who's deadline is Nov 1st? Another question is about 
my background. I didn't have any computer science related degree since 
my major is in microbiology. I decided to pursue a MS degree in CS after 
I start to learning some programing by my self this year. I found I have 
a lot of interests in this area. For my background, I do have some 
courses in math during my undergraduate study such as Calculus, Linear 
Algebra and Statistic. And I also have some experience in self-study 
programming in python. I was wondering whether my background is too weak 
to apply for the MS program in computer science. Do you have some 
background requirement for application who want to join the program? 
Please let me at your earliest convenience. Really appreciate it.

Looking forward to your reply.

Sincerely,

Yiwei

Dear Sirs; 

Greetings; 

My name is Wisam Makki Kadhim, Iraqi nationality, currently still living in Iraq, have a Master degree in computer sciences from Al- Nahrain University/ Iraq. Recently, I have been acquired an Iraqi scholarship to obtain a PhD degree in computer sciences in USA. 

My scholarship includes all the tuition and fees for my PhD courses in addition to language courses for six months (file attached). 

To be eligible to process my application with the Iraqi Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Affairs, I need to provide them with a prove of enrollment in your program. I do understand that one of the requirements for the International students is to have their TOFEL or any language equivalent certificate, but as I explained before, my scholarship already includes language courses for six months. 

Please advise if there is a possibility to be enrolled in your program and get an approval to be submitted to the Iraqi authorities in order to process the scholarship documents as requested by your university, and then be able to start the language courses within your university, or any other accredited program approved by you in the United States.
P.S.
My study in the B.Sc. and M.Sc. was full-time in English.

Thanks in advance for your prompt reply
Please accept my best regards

Wisam Makki Kadhim

	degree
Message-ID: <CA+krYfqk7myovt3h8B9cWoaspn2geukaqhWBt=YB3036-Xm6vA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Sir/Madam,

I would like to draw your kind attention on my inquiries about your
university in accepting UK undergraduate.

I am doing British Degree which is three years course on full time.  This
is my second year of Higher National Diploma (HND). I will top up to UK
university for third year. All together it will be three years  course with
360 credits. This UK degree, I am doing
from Nepal and I am thinking of taking online distance education for
getting B.Sc. (HONS) Computing. So at this moment, my inquiries are to know
that can I join your university in Master's  Degree in Computer Science
with software development
major. Please consider that I will have UK University degree and it may be
online but I will be having B.Sc. (Hons) Computing from recognized
university (may be Anglia Ruskin University, UK) I am good at Java,  are
there any programs that suites my
interests and strengths so that I can do more better coming to US.

I would love to have your kind advice on this context.

Sincerely,
Ujjwal Ghimire.

hi ,

I ,SAI RAM SUNKARA, got admission into MS in COMPUTER SCIENCE for spring
2015 term.
My OU-ID : 113306530

I am applying for a bank loan in my home country. In my i-20 normal length
of study is mentioned as 36 months, and tuition and fee is estimated as
16,980 $ for 18 credit hours for a period of 12 months.

Bank officials are asking for an *official letter* from you *stating that
usual period of study would be 24 months* ( that is for 18+18 i.e 36 credit
hours to reach minimum required credit hours ) to estimate the total cost
of living for 24 months.

please provide this to get the loan.

Thank you.

 Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition
Message-ID: <51F163D6B47CDA4AB4E7984B34E3DCBD1DA37DE354@MAIL-STOREA.tamusa.tamus.edu>

Hello,

We would like to take this opportunity to extend an invitation for your school to participate in the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) for 2015. The Southwest Region includes the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas.  We are trying to contact computing sciences programs within those states to increase the participation in the Southwest Region.  Your school has not participated in previous CCDCs and may not be aware of the competition.  Each school may have one competitive team, composed of eight students (no more than 2 graduate students).  Because each school is limited to a single team we have tried to send this email to representatives from each department that might have an information assurance or computer security program.  If this mail was sent to you by mistake, then please forward it to the appropriate person in your department or school.  If there is another department at your school listed in this email, you should coordinate with them, as only one team per school is allowed.

The CCDC is a defensive only computer security competition for college students.  A list of the teams is available at http://www.southwestccdc.org/.  This site also contains information about the national competition and links to websites that can assist a school that is just beginning their involvement in the competition.  Regional CCDCs are conducted early in the year (January to March) with the winners from each region competing in the National CCDC in April in San Antonio.  More information on the national competition can be found at http://nationalccdc.org/.

There is time for your school to consider whether it will participate or not in the coming year.  We intend to conduct the preliminary round of competition virtually, which saves on travel costs while allowing your teams to experience the activities of a CCDC event.  There is no expense associated with this preliminary competition and participation this year would give your school some idea of whether you might want to participate in future years.  Please review the information on our website and the National CCDC website, paying special attention to the information on the "Staring a 2015 team" link or click on the https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/2015SWCCDC registration link. You may also forward this to any schools in your area that may want to participate.

Please let us know if you want us to remove your name from the email list.  We will be sending out a registration reminders in the coming weeks. We ask that you register early if you plan to participate, as we will be using registration numbers to determine the schedule for the preliminary round of competitions.

Subject: [Cs] Invitation to Compete in the 2015 Southwest Regional
 Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition
Message-ID: <51F163D6B47CDA4AB4E7984B34E3DCBD1DA3ED62D2@MAIL-STOREA.tamusa.tamus.edu>

Hello,

We would like to take this opportunity to extend an invitation for your school to participate in the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) for 2015. The Southwest Region includes the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas.  We are trying to contact computing sciences programs within those states to increase the participation in the Southwest Region.  Your school has not participated in previous CCDCs and may not be aware of the competition.  Each school may have one competitive team, composed of eight students (no more than 2 graduate students).  Because each school is limited to a single team we have tried to send this email to representatives from each department that might have an information assurance or computer security program.  If this mail was sent to you by mistake, then please forward it to the appropriate person in your department or school.  If there is another department at your school listed in this email, you should coordinate with them, as only one team per school is allowed.

The CCDC is a defensive only computer security competition for college students.  A list of the teams is available at http://www.southwestccdc.org/.  This site also contains information about the national competition and links to websites that can assist a school that is just beginning their involvement in the competition.  Regional CCDCs are conducted early in the year (January to March) with the winners from each region competing in the National CCDC in April in San Antonio.  More information on the national competition can be found at http://nationalccdc.org/.

There is time for your school to consider whether it will participate or not in the coming year.  We intend to conduct the preliminary round of competition virtually, which saves on travel costs while allowing your teams to experience the activities of a CCDC event.  There is no expense associated with this preliminary competition and participation this year would give your school some idea of whether you might want to participate in future years.  Please review the information on our website and the National CCDC website, paying special attention to the information on the "Staring a 2015 team" link or clicking on the https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/2015SWCCDC registration link. You may also forward this to any schools in your area that may want to participate.

Please let us know if you want us to remove your name from the email list.  We will be sending out a registration reminders in the coming weeks. We ask that you register early if you plan to participate, as we will be using registration numbers to determine the schedule for the preliminary round of competitions.

I want to upload my SOP. When I read the graduate admission requirements on

Hi,

I plan on applying for MS computer science for fall 2015, and regarding the
documents required for the process I have a doubt. Other than the
transcripts do I need to send an official attested copy of degree
certificate as well?

Is it mandatory to submit the degree certificate because I have to go to my
university again and it's around 2000 KMs away from where I stay now!

Hi,

I have just found out about the Computational Technology minor and may be
interested in it. I would like to take Introduction to Programming in the
spring semester, but the times offered don't fit in my schedule.

I found this online course at my local community college - can you tell me
if it would transfer for CS 1323?

CSC 119 Introduction to Programming

3 Credits

Focuses on a general introduction to computer programming. Emphasizes the
design and implementation of structured and logically correct programs with
good documentation. Focuses on basic programming concepts, including
numbering systems, control structures, modularization, and data processing.
A structured programming language is used to implement the student?s
program designs.

http://www.arapahoe.edu/catalog/csc-119-introduction-to-programming.htm

If not, do you know of any other online options?

Thanks for your help,

Good Evening

My name is Gurpreet Kaur. I graduated in December 2013 with a Bachelor of Arts degree.
My student id is 112-69-1210.

Since then, I attended medical school, however i have withdrawn from the program. I now would like to re-enroll to OU and complete a BS degree in computer science engineering.

I completed my re-enrollment application on the 26th of November and have requested the medical school I attended to send a transcript to the office of admissions. I don't think there is any other requirement on my side needed to continue with enrollment/registration for this program. If there is, please let me know.

I indicated on my application that I would like to begin enrollment in the summer term of 2015, but if it is possible to get enrolled, registered, and advised quicker, I would appreciate it if I could start in the spring 2015 term. If there is anyway you could take a look at this and suggest what route what be the best to expedite this process, I would highly appreciate the assistance regarding this procedure.

If you need any further information or if further documents are needed from my end, please feel free to let me know.

Respectfully,
Gurpreet Kaur

Hello,
My name is Quochuy Vu (112887199) and I'm a Junior majoring in Electrical Engineering. I would like to also major in computer engineering so that I can double major. In order to do this, I need to start from the beginning of Computer Engineering program which requires me to take CS 1323. However, when I went to enroll it says that I need departmental permission. Can you please help me figure this out so that I may enroll in cs 1323 because it is a prereq to many of my other classes. Thanks!

Message-ID: <51F163D6B47CDA4AB4E7984B34E3DCBD1DA3ED6AD3@MAIL-STOREA.tamusa.tamus.edu>

Hello,

We would like to take this opportunity to extend an invitation for your school to participate in the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) for 2015. The Southwest Region includes the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas.  We are trying to contact computing sciences programs within those states to increase the participation in the Southwest Region.  Your school has not participated in previous CCDCs and may not be aware of the competition.  Each school may have one competitive team, composed of eight students (no more than 2 graduate students).  Because each school is limited to a single team we have tried to send this email to representatives from each department that might have an information assurance or computer security program.  If this mail was sent to you by mistake, then please forward it to the appropriate person in your department or school.  If there is another department at your school listed in this email, you should coordinate with them, as only one team per school is allowed.

The CCDC is a defensive only computer security competition for college students.  A list of the teams is available at http://www.southwestccdc.org/.  This site also contains information about the national competition and links to websites that can assist a school that is just beginning their involvement in the competition.  Regional CCDCs are conducted early in the year (January to March) with the winners from each region competing in the National CCDC in April in San Antonio.  More information on the national competition can be found at http://nationalccdc.org/.

There is time for your school to consider whether it will participate or not in the coming year.  We intend to conduct the preliminary round of competition virtually, which saves on travel costs while allowing your teams to experience the activities of a CCDC event.  There is no expense associated with this preliminary competition and participation this year would give your school some idea of whether you might want to participate in future years.  Please review the information on our website and the National CCDC website, paying special attention to the information on the "Staring a 2015 team" link or clicking on the https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/2015SWCCDC registration link. You may also forward this to any schools in your area that may want to participate.

Please let us know if you want us to remove your name from the email list.  We will be sending out a registration reminders in the coming weeks. We ask that you register early if you plan to participate, as we will be using registration numbers to determine the schedule for the preliminary round of competitions.

Dear OU Computer Science -

I am a prospective student interested in a master's. I have three questions:

1) Is there an option for a part time CS master's?
2) What is the class schedule typically like for working professionals?
Evening? Random?
3) Are there any set options to pair the study with an MBA?


Thanks,

I am applying for MS in computer science for fall 2015. I have finished all
my application process except the funding sources part where I have to
provide type of support and amount of support. I am sure that my type of
support is family support but I am not sure about the amount of support as
I do not have any official document regarding the type of support yet.
Because of this I cannot submit my application form. What should I do?

Dr. Dhall,

Hello. My name is Josh Hatzis (OU ID 113110317) and I was interested in enrolling in your Intro to Parallel Programming class (CS 4970). I am a PhD student in the Department of Geography and Environmental Sustainability and I am interested in scientific programming and I know learning to run programs in parallel would be very useful. I have taken classes in BASIC, C++, and FORTRAN, but mostly in recent years I have used FORTRAN. I am not sure what prior knowledge is required to succeed in this class, but I am still learning a lot when it comes to programming but I also feel like I understand the logic and just need practice to improve. Please let me know if you are willing to let me enroll in this class.

Thanks and best regards,
Josh Hatzis

Hello.

My name is Gabriel Machado, and I'm a Geophysics Master Student. I'm writing to see about the possibility of enrolling in Scientific Computing II, C S 5753, since I'm working with Dr. Marfurt in the Geophysics department and I'll involved in some coding, and he thought it would be a good idea for me to take the class. I have understood that I need permission from the department in order to enroll for the class, so I'm at your disposition as to whatever may be needed in order for me to take the class. I already took Scientific Computing I and got an overall grade of B.

Thank you very much in advance for your consideration to my case.

Best wishes.

To Whom It May Concern:

 

                My name is David Moran. I am a co owner of and a
meteorologist for a new meteorology company, National Storm Channel. This
company is owned by three meteorologists who are OU graduates. As part of
our company, we are developing a channel for the Roku platform. The channel
is to be written in the BrightScript language, a language with which none of
us are familiar. I am writing to ask if any student or faculty in your
department would be willing and able to help us finish this project. The
project is mostly written, but we are having difficulty completing it with
our limited knowledge of BrightScript. Please direct anyone who is
interested to contact me at  <mailto:david.moran at nationalstormchannel.com>
david.moran at nationalstormchannel.com. Thank you for your time and I look
forward to hearing from you.

 

Sincerely,

 

 

David Moran

Dear Sir or Madam

I am from Cambodia. I would like to pursue my master degree in your
university.
I have some questions about the admission requirement.

Now, I have not taken any English proficiency tests yet.
Is it possible for me to arrive the United States first and then take it?
And if I do not have enough score on English test, is possible for me to
study master degree in your university?
*Does your university accept paper based GRE?*
In Cambodia, it is available only paper base GRE.


Thanks,

Vutha

Message-ID: <1419567638721.14307@alumni.ou.edu>

Hello,


I am ?so interested in your DSA master program, and wanted to have a master degree in this new field. Based on my current situation, I have several questions about the admission application.

1) I graduated in July 2012 from the Department of Chemistry with a thesis master degree in Analytical Chemistry. If I apply for the DSA program, do I  need to submit TOEFL and GRE score again?

2) Currently, I am working in a school. So I really want to take your online classes. How many classes each semester do you require the students to complete?

3)  How much is the tuition for this class?  How much is the in-state tuition? Do you charge differently for online program?

4)  When will the class begin?

5) which day is the last day to submit the admission application?

?
I would greatly appreciate if you can help with above questions!

Thank you so much!

Jianguo

Dear Sir/Miss,
I am trying to apply into graduate Computer Science program at the University of Oklahoma. But while trying to choose the program using "Major Selection" page in application form, the programs box is empty. How do I get around this problem? (I have attached one image file to illustrate the problem)
Also a couple of questions -?1. Do I have to provide the financial documents during online form submission, can they be sent later using electronic mail?
2. While sending the official scores of GRE/TOEFL to Computer Science program, do I have to use the Departmental code too or just the Institution code will suffice??
Thank You for your time
Sincerely,Ashish KhanalKathmandu, Nepal

Hi Sir or Madam,

My name is Jiaying Li, a Master student from Rochester Institute of Technology. My major is Visual communication and focus on Interaction Design.  I want to pursue a Master of Science in Computer Science degree for Fall Semester. During my graduate study, I studied user experience design and found my passion about programing. I took many courses from Information Technology Department and also studied development languages by myself, including HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery.  My GPA is 3.35. 

I have a few questions about admission. I believe I have a good capability and language skill for pursuing the Master of Computer Science degree. Could I waive TOFEL test and GRE test?  or could I apply first and then submit tests later? 

Please let me know if I have an chance to study in Computer Science Program.

I hope to hear from you soon. 

Have a great weekends!

Best regards,
Jiaying Li

1.? What are the pre-requisites for this course?? Is a B.S. required or can personnel who hold a B.A.?? GRE?? Calculus?
2.? What is the cost per credit ?
3.? Is there a baseline level of computer science knowledge necessary or can the student start with little computer knowledge?
4.? Is a programming background necessary?
5.? Is there any more information available regarding the specific online courses that will be offered and what they entail?

Hello!

My name is Sam Marino, and I am on the recruitment team for Relay for life here at OU.   I was hoping that your student organization would be interested in forming a team for our event this year!

Just in case you aren't familiar with Relay For Life, it is an international organization that raises money for the American Cancer Society.  All of the money we raise goes directly to cancer research and programs for cancer patients in our community, and across the nation.  Students are able to form teams and fundraise throughout the year to support this great cause.  The actual event will take place on Friday, April 24th in the South Oval.  The event is filled with games, performers, fun competitions and music throughout the night.  We will also spend time celebrating and remembering those who have been affected or are currently battling cancer.

OU's Relay For Life raised over $120,000 last year, and we would love for your organizations to help us reach our goal of $200,000 this year.  One of my main goals for this year is to get the entire OU campus involved in Relay For Life so that we can work together to better our community, and hopefully make cancer history.

To sign up go to www.ou.edu/rela<http://www.ou.edu/relay>y and sign up as a Team Captain.  Once you are signed up as a Team Captain the other members of your organization will be able to sign up on your team, and you can all begin fundraising!

I would love the opportunity to come to one of your organization's upcoming meetings to speak with your group more about Relay For Life, if this is something you might be willing to do please let me know! We are also having a team captain meeting on Monday, February 2nd at 8:30 in Zarrow Hall.  If you are considering creating a team, I greatly encourage you to attend this meeting so you can get more information about the event!

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to email me at Samuel.F.Marino-1 at ou.edu, or I would be more than happy to set up a meeting with you or any of your organization's officers to help you through the process.

Thank you for your time, and I hope to hear from you soon!

With Respect,

Sam Marino

*Texas A&M University *
*NSF- Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program *
*Computing for Disasters*



*APPLICATION DEADLINE: March 1, 2015
<https://apply2.cse.tamu.edu/gts/applicant/reu/>  *

*PROGRAM DATES: June 2, 2015 ? August 7, 2015*


*PROGRAM INCLUDES:*

*  Hands-on research with responders

*  Seminars and brown bags on research & career development

*  Tours of TAMU laboratories & NASA Johnson

*  Weekly social activities with other students, mentors, & faculty


*AWARD:*

*  $5,000 for your research work for the summer

*  $1000 meal allowance

*  $1000 housing allowance (if not living in luxury housing provided)

*  Actual travel expenses to and from Texas A&M University


Summer 2015 will mark the third year that the Department of Computer
Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University is offering a summer REU
Program, Computing for Disasters. The program spans 10 weeks and involves
undergraduate students from Texas A&M as well as students from other
colleges and universities from across the United States. It is hoped that
the students participating in the CSE REU Computing for Disasters program
will make significant contributions to ongoing faculty research and, more
importantly, will gain an appreciation for and an interest in graduate
school and a future research career.

Disasters pose a comprehensive need for computing, where data must be
collected, transmitted, transformed, and displayed to stakeholders in
real-time, leading to the acronym of critical real-time computing and
information systems or CRICIS. Disasters are a natural focus because it
brings together research in "physical science and engineering (e.g.,
sensors, unmanned systems, models, etc.), social sources of data (e.g.,
social networking, citizen science, etc.), transfer and storage of data
(e.g., networks, cloud computing, context-aware networks, data warehousing,
security, privacy, etc.), transformation of data into useful information
(e.g., computer vision, human computation, etc.), real-time formal and
informal decision making support (e.g., artificial intelligence,
optimization, visualization, interfaces, cognitive science, CSCW, policy,
etc.)." However, disasters are more than a "big tent" offering a common
theme, they encourage expansion of existing research topics in new
directions because of the extreme temporal, geographical, stakeholder, and
data scales. In addition disaster management requires a new style of
research which emphasizes a holistic, multi-disciplinary approach similar
to the Smart Health and Well being programs at NSF.

Students are offered a specific project based on their interests and course
work as part of the acceptance process. They work with responders at
Disaster City in Week 1 and learn about human-centered design in computing,
then from week 2-9 work with their faculty and graduate mentors on
individual research projects. They also meet weekly as a cohort for brown
bag seminars on how to conduct research, career paths, and work/life
balance, and in week 10 present at two poster sessions. Students also tour
NASA Johnson Space Center and interact with industry and have lots of
social experiences.


*ELIGIBILITY:*

*  Undergraduate students majoring in computer science, computer
engineering, or related field

*  High school graduates who have been accepted at an undergraduate
institution but who have not yet started their undergraduate study are also
eligible to participate

*  U.S. Citizen or permanent resident

*  GPA of 3.0 or higher

*  Plan to graduate no earlier than December 2015

*  May not enroll in additional academic courses during the summer session

*  Minorities and women strongly encouraged to apply

Written by expert authors in both mathematics and biology, Algebraic and Discrete Mathematical Methods for Modern Biology offers a bridge between math and biology and provides a framework for simulating, analyzing, predicting, and modulating the behavior of complex biological systems. Each chapter begins with a question from modern biology, followed by the description of certain mathematical methods and theory appropriate in the search of answers.   

Every topic gives readers a fast-track pathway through the problem by presenting the biological foundation, covering the relevant mathematical theory, and highlighting connections between them. Multiple exercises and projects are embedded in each chapter. Many of the projects and exercises utilize specialized software, providing students with much-needed familiarity and experience with computing applications, critical components of the "modern biology" skill set.   

Algebraic and Discrete Mathematical Methods for Modern Biology is appropriate for mathematics courses such as finite mathematics, discrete structures, linear algebra, abstract/modern algebra, graph theory, probability, bioinformatics, statistics, biostatistics, and modeling, as well as for biology courses such as genetics, cell and molecular biology, biochemistry, ecology, and evolution.   

- Examines significant questions in modern biology and their mathematical treatments   
- Presents important mathematical concepts, methods, and tools in the context of essential biology   
- Features material of interest to students in both mathematics and biology   
- Presents chapters in modular format so topics taught in class need not follow the Table of Contents   
- Provides students with many examples and exercises to enhance comprehension   
- Introduces projects appropriate for undergraduate research   
- Utilizes freely accessible specialized software for visualization, simulation, and analysis in modern biology   
- Employs concepts from modern discrete mathematics and abstract algebra, which do not require calculus as a prerequisite

Certificate in Computer Science Education at St. Scholastica

Scratch. App Inventor. Java.

Even though they sound like a team of superheroes from a comic book, these names
 represent some of the latest advancements in computer science education. And as
 a computer science teacher, you'll be expected to keep pace with all of them &#x2212;

Subject: [Cs] Speaking to Programming Classes
Message-ID: <etPan.54d91b99.38437fdb.128@aarons-mbp.local>

Hello,

Hello, my name is Aaron Krauss, and I?m a programmer in the Edmond / Oklahoma City area. I?m a 24 year old developer who?s been in the programming world for a while now, and I really enjoy speaking to students about the things that I wish I knew when I was in school studying programming.

I would love to know if any of the OU CS professors would be interested in having me speak to your students for a class (or half a class - I know you have busy class schedules) sometime this semester about what being a developer in the real world is like. I?ve given this talk a few times at other college classes and AP high school programming classes, and it usually ends up being 40ish minutes. The teachers have always told me that it?s valuable for the students to get an idea of what it?s like to be a developer, the things that I deal with, and the things they should be learning on their own in addition to what school is teaching them. It?s not so much teaching new material as it is showing them how massive the programming world is, and everything they could be doing.

I've really enjoyed giving these talks, and if you are interested, I?d certainly enjoy speaking to as many classes as you would deem beneficial. Here?s a PDF of my speaking outline:?

http://thesocietea.org/assets/documents/programming_speaking_outline.pdf

And you can take a look at my personal site if you?d like to learn more about me: http://thesocietea.org/

Thanks so much for your time, and feel free to ask me anything. This is all of my own free will, so definitely no payment or anything is expected; I just really enjoy speaking to and helping students.

Take care,

Aaron Krauss
Developer
thesocietea.org

P.S. I did graduate from OU?s MIS school in 2012 if that grants me any brownie points - though I chose to stay on the path of hardcore programming.

Subject: [Cs] ICNC-FSKD 2015 Submissions due 10 February: Submitting to IEEE
	Xplore/EI Compendex/ISI 2015/2/10 8:47:34 z54nd
Message-ID: <20150210084734326216@hnu.edu.cn>

Dear Colleague,
 
We cordially invite you to submit a paper to the upcoming 2015 11th International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC 2015) and 2015 12th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD 2015), to be jointly held from 15-17 August 2015 in Zhangjiajie, China. 
 
Zhangjiajie is a city in the northwestern part of Hunan province. Nearby is the Wulingyuan Scenic Area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and an AAAAA (the highest class) scenic area in China. Towering sandstones mesas, dense forests, and deep ravines form the gorgeous and mysterious natural landscape. With many spectacularly-shaped stone pillars, hidden valleys, seas of cloud, majestic waterfalls, wandering streams, clear lakes, and limestone caves, Wulingyuan is a must-see in China. Avatar, James Cameron?s block-buster movie, did much of its filming in these beautiful mountains.  
 
As with the past ICNC-FSKD conferences, all papers in conference proceedings will be submitted to both EI Compendex and ISTP (ISI Proceedings), as well as IEEE Xplore (all previous ICNC-FSKD conferences from 2005 to 2013 have been indexed in Ei Compendex). Extended versions of selected best papers will appear in an ICNC-FSKD special issue of International Journal on Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, a SCI-index journal. ICNC-FSKD 2015 is technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society (pending).
 
ICNC-FSKD is a premier international forum for scientists and researchers to present the state of the art of data mining and intelligent methods inspired from nature, particularly biological, linguistic, and physical systems, with applications to computers, circuits, systems, control, robotics, communications, and more. This is an exciting and emerging interdisciplinary area in which a wide range of theory and methodologies are being investigated and developed to tackle complex and challenging problems. The registration fee of US-D410 includes proceedings, lunches, dinners, banquet, coffee breaks, and all technical sessions.
 
To promote international participation of researchers from outside the country/region where the conference is held (i.e., China?s mainland), researchers outside of China?s mainland are encouraged to propose invited sessions. An honorarium of US-D400 will be enjoyed by the organizer(s) for each completed (with at least 6 registered papers) invited session. The first author of each paper in an invited session must not be affiliated with an organization in China?s mainland. "(Invited Paper)" may be added below the title of each paper in the invited sessions. Invited session organizers will solicit submissions, conduct reviews and recommend accept/reject decisions on the submitted papers. Invited session organizers will be able to set their own submission and review schedules, as long as a set of recommended papers is determined by 3 June 2015. Each invited session proposal should include: (1) the name, bio, and contact information of each organizer of the invited session; (2) the title and a short synopsis of the invited session. Please send your proposal to icnc-fskd at hnu.edu.cn
 
For more information, visit the conference web page:

Message-ID: <CAL5kydjwd2MPa2Ze-=08tHNjoMWpwQ1a9bjMGRJCvxr7zkKGcQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

My name is Madison Richardson and I am interested in pursing a career in
computer science. Specifically, I would eventually like to focus on cyber
security, but I would like to have a solid, and well-rounded IT background.

I currently hold a BA in International Studies and a MA in Southeast Asian
Studies. I have had some advanced math and science courses, but otherwise I
currently have no background in IT/CS. I would rather not spend 4-6 years
earning a BS/MS in computer science if it is not necessary. I was recently
informed that I may be able to accelerate the process by first completing
something like a comptia A+.

So, I'm wondering what is the best, quickest, and most cost effective way
for me to enter the field?

I would appreciate any information/advice you might be able to offer me.

Sincerely,
Madison

Hi Computer,

Welcome to Carousel, the gallery from Dropbox for all your photos and videos. Carousel is even better on your phone or tablet: download the  iOS[1]  or  Android[2]  app for all the features and the best experience.

Here?s a quick look at what Carousel can help you do:


 - Keep your photos safe.  Carousel automatically backs your photos up to Dropbox and organizes them for you.
 
 - Share your way.  Share full-resolution photos quickly and privately through Carousel, or post to your favorite apps and social networks.
 
 - Relive your memories.  Our Flashback feature can surface great photos you may have forgotten about.
 
 - Free up space on your phone.  Once Carousel has backed up your photos, it can remove them from your phone's local storage. No more compromising between photos and phone space.


Any questions? Ideas for what would make Carousel better? Visit  the forums[3]  and start a discussion!

Hi Computer,

Did you know that it's easy to get more space for your Dropbox?

Upgrade your Dropbox[1]

When you upgrade your Dropbox, you can:

 - Put everything in Dropbox  with 1 TB (1,000 GB) of space for your photos, videos, docs, and other files
 - Protect the stuff you share  by adding passwords and expirations to shared links
 - Simplify collaboration  with view-only permissions for shared folders
 - Keep your stuff safe  with remote wipe for lost devices


Happy Dropboxing!
- The Dropbox Team

Hello Mosunmade,

The OU-Tulsa campus does not have your transcript, and I checked our imaging system and we have no record of ever receiving this document.  Since your transcript was mailed five months ago, we should have received it by now.  Given this situation, I would recommend that you request another official transcript be sent to our office at your earliest convenience.  Please send it to:

It does not appear that we have received your official transcript from Ladoke Akintola University of Technology yet.  You may scan and email an unofficial copy of your transcript if you have one in your possession.  You may also send  your statement of result by email to our office.  Submission of your unofficial transcript is sufficient for the application review process, but if you are selected for admission you will be required to submit your official transcript to our office.

Please know that we will process your application by your departmental deadline, and you can follow the status of your application by logging into your student portal at http://www.applyweb.com/cgi-bin/ustat.

Dear Mosunmade,

Thank you for submitting your application to the Computer Science, M.S. program at the University of Oklahoma. The Office of Graduate Admissions cannot review your application at this time since you failed to upload a transcript from your last degree-granting institution.

In order for your application to move forward in the review process, please reply to this email as soon as possible and attach a scanned copy of your transcript, mark-sheets and/or degree certificate (if applicable).

To check the status of your application and documents throughout the review process, please log into your student portal<http://messages.collegenet.com/r/c/t7vBGBRLkY-VsN4jbz5CeQ?i=9768814>. You will use the same email address and password used to create your application.

Failure to submit the required transcript in a timely manner will delay the review process for your Fall 2015 application.

Subject: [Cs] TEKsystems, wanting to hire BS Computer Science undergraduates
Message-ID: <D1D89E6CDFA0974EAAECE0300257B1B30148E1158F42@EXCH-MBX27.allegisgroup.com>

Hi,

I am a project manager and business analyst recruiter at TEKsystems in Oklahoma City. TEKsystems is the #1 IT Staffing and Services company in the nation. We rarely work at staffing junior level positions, though we have recently acquired the need for 2 junior level business analysts. We are hoping to find 2 students who have either graduated recently or are graduating this May in Computer Science and who are eager to learn and advance their career. They would be working officially as "business analysts" or "business systems analysts" for Mercury Insurance in Oklahoma City. The pay would be ~$15/hour for a 6 month 40 hour/week contract. It's a great way to start building a career in the IT community now, great pay, and a good way to build up the resume early.

If there is anyone in particular I should speak to, please forward my information along to the respective party.

Respectfully,



Annaly Sullivan | Applications-Project Management & Business Analyst Recruiter

Subject: [Cs] ICNC-FSKD 2015 Submissions Extended 15 March: Submitting to
	IEEE Xplore/EI Compendex/ISI 2015/2/24 7:37:31 bq5jkjfw
Message-ID: <20150224073731062456@hnu.edu.cn>

Dear Colleague,
 
We cordially invite you to submit a paper to the upcoming 2015 11th International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC 2015) and 2015 12th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD 2015), to be jointly held from 15-17 August 2015 in Zhangjiajie, China. Due to numerous requests, the submission deadline is extended to 15 March 2015.
 
Zhangjiajie is a city in the northwestern part of Hunan province. Nearby is the Wulingyuan Scenic Area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and an AAAAA (the highest class) scenic area in China. Towering sandstones mesas, dense forests, and deep ravines form the gorgeous and mysterious natural landscape. With many spectacularly-shaped stone pillars, hidden valleys, seas of cloud, majestic waterfalls, wandering streams, clear lakes, and limestone caves, Wulingyuan is a must-see in China. Avatar, James Cameron?s block-buster movie, did much of its filming in these beautiful mountains.  
 
As with the past ICNC-FSKD conferences, all papers in conference proceedings will be submitted to both EI Compendex and ISTP (ISI Proceedings), as well as IEEE Xplore (all previous ICNC-FSKD conferences from 2005 to 2013 have been indexed in Ei Compendex). Extended versions of selected best papers will appear in an ICNC-FSKD special issue of International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, a SCI-index journal. ICNC-FSKD 2015 is technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society (pending).
 
ICNC-FSKD is a premier international forum for scientists and researchers to present the state of the art of data mining and intelligent methods inspired from nature, particularly biological, linguistic, and physical systems, with applications to computers, circuits, systems, control, robotics, communications, and more. This is an exciting and emerging interdisciplinary area in which a wide range of theory and methodologies are being investigated and developed to tackle complex and challenging problems. The registration fee of US-D410 includes proceedings, lunches, dinners, banquet, coffee breaks, and all technical sessions.
 
To promote international participation of researchers from outside the country/region where the conference is held (i.e., China?s mainland), researchers outside of China?s mainland are encouraged to propose invited sessions. An honorarium of US-D400 will be enjoyed by the organizer(s) for each completed (with at least 6 registered papers) invited session. The first author of each paper in an invited session must not be affiliated with an organization in China?s mainland. "(Invited Paper)" may be added below the title of each paper in the invited sessions. Invited session organizers will solicit submissions, conduct reviews and recommend accept/reject decisions on the submitted papers. Invited session organizers will be able to set their own submission and review schedules, as long as a set of recommended papers is determined by 3 June 2015. Each invited session proposal should include: (1) the name, bio, and contact information of each organizer of the invited session; (2) the title and a short synopsis of the invited session. Please send your proposal to icnc-fskd at hnu.edu.cn
 
For more information, visit the conference web page:
 
   http://icnc-fskd.hnu.edu.cn/
 
If you have any questions after visiting the conference web page, please email the secretariat at icnc-fskd at hnu.edu.cn
 
Join us at this major event in beautiful Zhangjiajie !!!

Hello,

My name is Collin Benton and I am a Junior at Cypress Ranch High School in Cypress, Texas.  I am very interested in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering.  I have been researching colleges and learning about the University of Oklahoma and am very impressed by what I have found.    I am currently in the 1st quarter of my class and have scored an 1860 on the SAT.   I have not taken the ACT yet, but it is scheduled for later in the school year and I will be taking the SAT for the second time in the next few months.

I will be traveling to Oklahoma on Wednesday, April 1st to attend a college visit in Tulsa and would like to see if I can schedule a visit on Thursday, April 2nd.  Since that is Easter weekend, I understand that may not be a possibility.  If it is not, is there anyone here in the Houston area that I may be able to meet with to discuss your Engineering or Computer Science  programs?

Thank you for your time.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Collin Benton
832-748-8048

Hi,

I would like to apply for a master course in computer science from Spring
semester 2016,

I have some questions about the application process:

1. Do I need to contact supervisor  before  applying?
2. Is there any scholarship or teaching assistant  opportunity, if so, how
can I apply for it?

Best,

Dear Sir/Mam

I am an International student from Nepal.
Due to internet connections problem and changing load-shedding schedules of
electricity, I could not submit applications within international
deadlines. I have submitted my online application today, and I have sent my
transcripts to the following address

University of Oklahoma
School of Computer Science
Graduate Programs
110 W.  Boyd Street, DEH 150
Norman, Oklahoma 73019
Phone: (405) 325-2055 or (405) 325-4042

Can my application be considered for fall semester? Is there anything I can
do for my applications to be considered?

With Regards
Upashana Ghimire

Subject: [Cs] Interest in a degree in Computer Science
Message-ID: <CAK_EErpKn147Pzz-ef3oL+Sr6Wdv8iabdZOpJW8EYNsHXs3dCQ@mail.gmail.com>

OU Computer Science Department:

I am interested in working toward a degree in Computer Science through OU,
but am unsure which track would be best for me.  I received a Bachelor of
Science in Business Administration (Accounting) and a Master of Accounting
in 2002 from Ohio State University, and a Master in Divinity from Saint
Paul School of Theology in 2010.  For the last two and a half years I've
been developing mobile apps, and have developed decent skills in
objective-c, java and php.  I also have a basic working knowledge of C, C#
and FASM.

Should I be looking at the Master in Computer Science degree or the
undergraduate degree?  If the latter, what would that look like given my
current education?

Thanks,

Chris

Dear Sir/Ma'am:



We are writing today to inquire about the *MS in Computer Science*. We have
students who are interested to pursue the program, but before we formally
submit an application, we wish that you can help us answer the following:



1.        Is the Program open for International Students? (Saudi Students)



2.        Do you offer Conditional Admission on TOEFL and GRE? This under
the presumption that students are going to take English courses and GRE
test at your university/recommended institutes.



3.        Is GRE required at the time of application or can it be added as
part of the conditional admission?



4.        Do the university have a language institute where the student can
take additional English courses?



5.        What is the minimum required English test Score?



6.        What is the minimum grade (GPA) entry requirement of the
programs?



7.      Do you require Academic Transcripts be evaluated by a third party
credential evaluator like WES or you it can be done internally from your
end?



We are looking forward to hear from you. Thank you.





Kind regards,





Rodshan Ferreras

	IEEE Xplore/EI Compendex/ISI 2015/3/8 9:47:38 lkfk
Message-ID: <20150308094738327405@hnu.edu.cn>

Dear Colleague,
 
We cordially invite you to submit a paper to the upcoming 2015 11th International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC 2015) and 2015 12th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD 2015), to be jointly held from 15-17 August 2015 in Zhangjiajie, China. Due to numerous requests, the submission deadline is extended to 15 March 2015.
 
Zhangjiajie is a city in the northwestern part of Hunan province. Nearby is the Wulingyuan Scenic Area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and an AAAAA (the highest class) scenic area in China. Towering sandstones mesas, dense forests, and deep ravines form the gorgeous and mysterious natural landscape. With many spectacularly-shaped stone pillars, hidden valleys, seas of cloud, majestic waterfalls, wandering streams, clear lakes, and limestone caves, Wulingyuan is a must-see in China. Avatar, James Cameron?s block-buster movie, did much of its filming in these beautiful mountains.  
 
As with the past ICNC-FSKD conferences, all papers in conference proceedings will be submitted to both EI Compendex and ISTP (ISI Proceedings), as well as IEEE Xplore (all previous ICNC-FSKD conferences from 2005 to 2013 have been indexed in Ei Compendex). Extended versions of selected best papers will appear in an ICNC-FSKD special issue of International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, a SCI-index journal. ICNC-FSKD 2015 is technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society (pending).
 
ICNC-FSKD is a premier international forum for scientists and researchers to present the state of the art of data mining and intelligent methods inspired from nature, particularly biological, linguistic, and physical systems, with applications to computers, circuits, systems, control, robotics, communications, and more. This is an exciting and emerging interdisciplinary area in which a wide range of theory and methodologies are being investigated and developed to tackle complex and challenging problems. The registration fee of US-D410 includes proceedings, lunches, dinners, banquet, coffee breaks, and all technical sessions.
 
To promote international participation of researchers from outside the country/region where the conference is held (i.e., China?s mainland), researchers outside of China?s mainland are encouraged to propose invited sessions. An honorarium of US-D400 will be enjoyed by the organizer(s) for each completed (with at least 6 registered papers) invited session. The first author of each paper in an invited session must not be affiliated with an organization in China?s mainland. "(Invited Paper)" may be added below the title of each paper in the invited sessions. Invited session organizers will solicit submissions, conduct reviews and recommend accept/reject decisions on the submitted papers. Invited session organizers will be able to set their own submission and review schedules, as long as a set of recommended papers is determined by 3 June 2015. Each invited session proposal should include: (1) the name, bio, and contact information of each organizer of the invited session; (2) the title and a short synopsis of the invited session. Please send your proposal to icnc-fskd at hnu.edu.cn
 
For more information, visit the conference web page:
 
   http://icnc-fskd.hnu.edu.cn/
 
If you have any questions after visiting the conference web page, please email the secretariat at icnc-fskd at hnu.edu.cn
 
Join us at this major event in beautiful Zhangjiajie !!!

Hello CS department at OU!

You may have already heard, but I wanted to help spread the word that
Seagate's OKC team is hosting an information session tomorrow (3/10 @ 5:30
PM) and on-campus interviews on 3/26.
We have several open positions and are looking for CS students interested
in internships and full-time opportunities.

I'm attaching a flyer with the pertinent details. Could you share this with
your students? Our team would love to meet them!

Many Thanks,

Subject: [Cs] Summer -Intro to Programming Course
Message-ID: <5BFF3DEF60142B4F86DFFB191B84708101F558D5C4@it-monad.sooner.net.ou.edu>

Good Afternoon

I am currently enrolled into cs 1323 for this summer. I was previously enrolled, but was automatically dropped from the course for some reason on the 5th. I tried to re-enroll, and ozone allowed me. So I proceeded with enrollment and registered for this course.

My concern regarding this course is will it still be offered even with a low enrollment? My fall enrollment into certain classes is dependent on enrollment into this course, so I was concerned of whether or not this class will be offered and how I should plan my next semester.

Respectfully,
Gurpreet Kaur (ID 112-69-1210)

I recently learned of the Master degree scholarships program you are
offering and I would like to

Apply for the master's Degree in computer science at your university, I
duly completed my studies in Bachelor of information technology. I would
like to continue my studies in order to gain applied knowledge and
experience by taking part of your masters program. That is why, I would
like to request for some more important pertinent information about the
program I am interested in.



I would greatly appreciate it if you provide with me some information on
the curricula of the master degree what the schedule would be, the
admission requirements are, and any further additional information I should
be aware of. Please take into account that I am a foreign student for any
possible requirements that need to be covered up



I look forward to hearing from you in the near future. Thank you very much
in advance for your  support



Yours faithfully

Hello,

I was wondering if any computer science classes are taught in the
Tulsa area, or are part of distance learning (ITV) type classes that
broadcast from Norman to Tulsa.

I'm thinking of pursuing my Master's and I'm trying to gather
information from schools around here to better make my decision.

You can reach me at this email, or call 918.616.0931.

Thank you!

Dear Prof. Gruenwald,



Below you will find an announcement for an NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program offered this summer. I would be very grateful, if you could forward it to the undergraduate students in your department, as you did last year (for which I am obliged to you).



Regards,



Dr. Georgios C. Anagnostopoulos

=== THE 2015 AMALTHEA REU PROGRAM ===





AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A 10-WEEK RESEARCH EXPERIENCE FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS is available in the area of Machine Learning. The program is sponsored by the National Science Foundation and is offered by the Information Characterization & Exploitation (ICE) Laboratory at Florida Institute of Technology (FIT) in Melbourne, Florida.



Machine Learning (ML) gradually evolved as a branch of Artificial Intelligence with its theory and applications positioned at the juncture of Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, Statistics and, even, Physics. Nowadays, ML's role in successfully addressing hard, real-world technological challenges has become ever more current and central. Moreover, its presence and importance now permeates several aspects not only of cutting-edge technology such as computer vision, stock market prediction and big data analytics, but also our daily life through voice-driven searches on our smart phones or movie recommendations on video streaming services to name only a few.



The program currently accepts applications in order to form a very diverse, multi-disciplinary cohort of nascent researchers for this summer. Minorities, women and people with disabilities are especially encouraged to apply.



ELIGIBILITY

Without exceptions, applicants must be:

=> Majoring in an Engineering or Science discipline

=> US citizens or permanent residents

=> Undergraduates in good academic standing



BENEFITS

=> Exposure to the exciting world of Machine Learning and its applications

=> Participate in a one-week crash course to familiarize yourself with Machine Learning

=> Work with experienced student mentors and experts in the field

=> Participate and contribute to cutting-edge Machine Learning research

=> Take part in visits to our local industry

=> Paid travel and accommodation expenses

=> Receive a competitive stipend for per diem expenses

=> Visit Central Florida venues such as Disney attractions and NASA's Kennedy Space Center

=> Meet new people

=> Make new friends



Application Deadline: March 31, 2015

Apply online: http://www.amalthea-reu.org

The IEEE International Conference on Data Mining series (ICDM) has
established itself as the world's premier research conference in data
mining. It provides an international forum for presentation of
original research results, as well as exchange and dissemination of
innovative, practical development experiences. The conference covers
all aspects of data mining, including algorithms, software and
systems, and applications. ICDM draws researchers and application
developers from a wide range of data mining related areas such as
statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, databases and data
warehousing, data visualization, knowledge-based systems, and high
performance computing. By promoting novel, high quality research
findings, and innovative solutions to challenging data mining
problems, the conference seeks to continuously advance the
state-of-the-art in data mining. Besides the technical program, the
conference features workshops, tutorials, panels and, since 2007, the
ICDM data mining contest.

Topics of Interest
******************

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Foundations, algorithms, models, and theory of data mining
* Machine learning and statistical methods for data mining
* Mining text, semi-structured, spatio-temporal, streaming, graph,
  web, multimedia data
* Data mining systems and platforms, their efficiency, scalability,
  and privacy
* Data mining in modeling, visualization, personalization, and
recommendation
* Applications of data mining in all domains including social, web,
  bioinformatics, and finance

Submission Guidelines
*********************

Paper submissions should be limited to a maximum of ten (10) pages, in
the IEEE 2-column format (templates available at
http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html
),
including the bibliography and any possible appendices. Submissions
longer than 10 pages will be rejected without a review. All
submissions will be triple-blind reviewed by the Program Committee on
the basis of technical quality, relevance to data mining, originality,
significance, and clarity. Author names and affiliations must not
appear in the submissions, and bibliographic references must be
adjusted to preserve author anonymity. Accepted papers will be
published in the conference proceedings by the IEEE Computer Society
Press.

All manuscripts are submitted as full papers and are reviewed based on
their scientific merit. There is no separate abstract submission
step. There are no separate industrial, application, short paper or
poster tracks.

Manuscripts must be submitted electronically in online submission
system (https://wi-lab.com/cyberchair/2015/icdm15/cbc_index.php). We
do not accept email submissions.

Repeatability
*************

Every effort should be made to enable the code and the datasets (or
their closest publicly available equivalents) and all relevant
parameter specifications available to reviewers and readers so that
the results can be independently replicated. While we cannot expect
*every* dataset used to be made public, it is in the best interest of
the authors to make as many as possible available (in the worst case,
a sampled or an anonymized version). To retain anonymity of
submissions, any such additional material should be anonymized as
well, and be published on an anonymous website (such as DropBox). The
repeatability factor will play an important role in the reviewer's
assessment of the submission.

Best Paper Awards
*****************

Awards will be conferred at the conference on the authors of the best
research paper, the best application paper, and the best student
paper. A selected number of accepted papers will be invited for
possible inclusion, in an expanded and revised form, in the Knowledge
and Information Systems journal published by Springer-Verlag.

Attendance
**********

ICDM is forum for presenting and discussing current research in data
mining. Therefore, at least one author of an accepted paper must
complete a regular conference registration and present the paper in
the conference, in order for the paper to be included in the
proceedings and program.

From: mlanders at google.com (Michelle Landers)
Date: Mon, 23 Mar 2015 14:47:27 -0700
Subject: [Cs] Invitation to Host Google Virtual Outreach Event at University
 of Oklahoma, Norman
Message-ID: <CAGbT9VyEhgf+ZZGm2zftPm=9=7eEWCB06azrskBt5tRm-zR1og@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

My name is Michelle Landers and I'm a University Specialist at Google.
Although I can't physically make it out to campus, I would love to conduct
virtual outreach at UoO to speak with Computer Science/Engineering students
about Google's culture and opportunities.

*What*: Virtual outreach consists of a tech talk and Q&A session given over
Google Hangouts.
*Who*: Any Computer Science or Computer Engineering student (Unfortunately
we're not able to accommodate requests to speak with other majors at this
time)
*When*: Flexible - I'm available most afternoons/ evenings the first or
second week of April 2015
*Where*: Any room on campus large enough to accommodate the number of
students interested
*Why*: Learn more about Google products, projects, opportunities and
culture directly from the mouth of a Googler

Because I won't physically be there, here are some of the tasks you/ the
University would responsible for completing in order to set up the virtual
event on campus:

   - Connect with the Career Services office to ensure virtual outreach is
   possible
   - Secure a presentation-enabled (wifi, audio, visual) room on campus to
   host event
   - Distribute and market event with flyers, emails and RSVP/Sign-in form
   - Note: I will provide you with flyer templates, email templates, and
   the RSVP/Sign-in form
   - Troubleshooting set-up issues in the reserved room, at least ~30
   minutes prior to event start
   - Act as moderator by ensuring students use the RSVP/Sign-in form upon
   entrance and by acting as a facilitator during session for Q&A


If you have any further questions or need more clarification, please feel
free to reach out to me directly. Thanks and I look forward to hearing back
from you soon!

Best,


--

Hi, just a reminder that you're receiving this email because you have expressed 
an interest in CSTA. Don't forget to add announcements at csta-hq.org to your address
book so we'll be sure to land in your inbox!
Computer Science Educators,

GG|Interactive, a fifteen-year veteran video game studio based in Vancouver, WA,
 is offering a computer science curriculum focused on digital game design and programming.
Schools can receive an unlimited number of licenses for the curriculum at no cost
but you must register at www.GGInteractive.com [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001bLFOCcncZLxsT5utFLKo8Q7GE5VDZ9ZSSx2azzoktPjmKqXHDF2TMYagqBlTG20vdkoETrKOwFNCxVgKL1XuRayTHd_57OqdQ-aUL8WEBhCH5tM37OC0Jz2pZ9TjJXor3t6_os_W8w7H4WCCc_2Guvkrlls8rn3BB6TrQs0IeKbv5AMzCfVcNw==&c=aZaawaMaR1njfBmga6kiOj9beKLQTFAPZtNbARQZsrdq-2AmGjf7Og==&ch=aimPNNEeWnRkEQnciwLw8Dcn1YO7rBCeUxXIi8SSlSV3nYBR2d1NrQ==]
by midnight, March 31st.

In 2013, the fifth largest school district in the United States asked us to help
 design a framework and standard, for teaching game design and development courses.
Once complete, we learned that schools and teachers had very few options for supporting
curriculum to teach game design or game programming courses. In response, we created
our education division.

Teachers started teaching our courses worldwide in late 2014. The curriculum includes
video lectures, assessments, exercises, and reference text; combined with a glossary,
index, and teacher guides. It is roughly 120 hours of coursework and is designed
 for the teacher with little or no computer science experience. To date, we have
 had over 500 schools and 20,000 students registered for the curriculum.

You can begin your free year immediately, or you can wait and start this coming 
fall for the 2015-16 school year, the choice is yours. Just register yourself as
 a teacher, on the site now. There is no contract or obligation to use this in the
future, although we are confident you will like what you see.

Again, this promotion ends on March 31st at midnight. You need to act quickly and
register as soon as possible. Please visit our website (www.GGInteractive.com [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001bLFOCcncZLxsT5utFLKo8Q7GE5VDZ9ZSSx2azzoktPjmKqXHDF2TMYagqBlTG20vdkoETrKOwFNCxVgKL1XuRayTHd_57OqdQ-aUL8WEBhCH5tM37OC0Jz2pZ9TjJXor3t6_os_W8w7H4WCCc_2Guvkrlls8rn3BB6TrQs0IeKbv5AMzCfVcNw==&c=aZaawaMaR1njfBmga6kiOj9beKLQTFAPZtNbARQZsrdq-2AmGjf7Og==&ch=aimPNNEeWnRkEQnciwLw8Dcn1YO7rBCeUxXIi8SSlSV3nYBR2d1NrQ==])

Hello,
I am working towards a CS minor and was hoping to take the following CS classes next semester (fall 2015):  2334, 2413, 3113. I am unable to enroll in the last two in that list since their prerequisites are in that list as well. Would it be possible for me to get permission to take them as co-requisites or are they strictly prerequisites?

Thank you for your time and consideration,
Victoria Trost

Hello,

My name is Marsela Haave and I have finished my studies in computer science
in Albania, Europe.
I will be living in Oklahoma City with my husband. I would like to have a
computer science degree from your university but I don't know how as I am
new in here.
I have evaluated my diploma degree through WES and the result is that I
have 150 credits. If you need a copy I can send it to you.
As I am not sure what should I do, I need your assistance to get the
information and to do things in the right way to get the computer science
degree from your university. I mean the documents I should bring or the
steps I should follow in order to finalize the procedures.

Thank you in advance and looking forward to hear from you

Best regards

Hi,

I hope you're doing well! I work on the University Recruiting team at
RetailMeNot, Inc., and we're currently looking to add to our list of
schools we visit for on-campus recruiting. I was wondering if you could
give me a little more information about the Computer Science program at OU.

I'm looking for the total number of Computer Science undergraduates at OU
and the race/gender breakdown within that population. Do you have an Annual
Statistical Report that contains this information that you could send me?

Are any of your career fairs for corporate partners only? If so, what is
the pricing package for partners?

I look forward to hearing from you!

Thanks,
Katie

Subject: [Cs] First year placement
Message-ID: <CAJeJr+D=y5M-0MzwA0ycBp3gt_q7Um0-TAH2jPQF3rVjNWmJKg@mail.gmail.com>

I'm a senior in high school this year and have been accepted into OU and am
interested in studying comp sci. I've taken and passed the AP computer
science a test, but this year I have worked with the teacher at my school
to keep studying passed that material (getting into data structures in
Java, hardware, and the trifecta of HTML, CSS and Javascript). So I'm
interested in how you place first year students in classes, and if there is
a way to not be put in classes that would be repetitive of this year for me.
Thank  you for your time!

To our valued CSTA members,

Our 2015 annual conference is fast-approaching. This year, as you may be aware, 
we're in Grapevine, Texas, and we're excited to have excellent, top-notch speakers
presenting on all things computer science related.

An important role at any event such as ours is that of an inspirational, exciting
keynote speaker. We feel honored to have Randy Pitchford, CEO/President of Gearbox
Software to be our afternoon keynote presenter to close our conference on a high
 point. This is where we need your help! Gearbox has come up with three engaging
 titles for their presentation, and you, our members get to choose which one it 
will be! Which of the following best suites your fancy and gauges the most interest?
Please respond to our poll by Friday, April 17. We'll compile answers and send to
Gearbox so that they can best speak to your interests. See if your suggestion made
the cut and join us for this presentation, and plenty more at our summer conference,
July 12-14 at the Hilton DFW Lakes Executive Conference Center: www.cstaconference.org.

Hello, my name is Logan Herrera and I contacted the CS department earlier this week and spoke to someone named Brandon. I left him a message because I currently have interest in switching my major to CS. I just had a few questions regarding CS and the process if I do chose to take that path. I?m sure your department is quite busy, but if I could speak to someone about this fairly soon that would be great. You may contact me at 405-306-7407. 

Thank you for your time,

Logan Herrera

Dear ,




My name is Ahmad Hariri, a teaching assistant at the CS Department, Faculty
of Computing & Information Technology at King Abdulaziz University.
Recently, I received a scholarship from the Ministry of Higher Education in
Saudi Arabia to continue my MS degree in Computer Science.



I would like to ask you if your department offers a conditional admission
to the MS in Computer Science program for international students who are
still working on their GRE and TEOFL?



Looking forward to hearing from you.


Sincerely,

Ahmad Hariri

Hi, just a reminder that you're receiving this email because you have expressed 
an interest in CSTA. Don't forget to add announcements at csta-hq.org to your address

Nationwide Open-Enrollment Workshop for Bootstrap!
Philadelphia, PA :: August 5th-7th, 2015

We're thrilled to announce our biggest workshop of the year, held at the University
of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science on August 5th-7th. Most
of our workshops are offered through school districts or partner institutions, but
we want to make this PD available for everyone. If you've wanted to attend our PD
in the past, but weren't able to bring Bootstrap to your district, this is your 
chance! We're grateful to Stephanie Weirich and others at Penn for their support,
enabling us to open Bootstrap to educators everywhere. Join teachers from across
 the country, and discover how to bring Boostrap to your classroom, afterschool 
program or summer camp. Registrations are handled on a first-come, first-served 
basis, putting every educator on the same footing - regardless of the size of your
school district. Enrollment is limited, so reserve your seat today! (Fee: $150/person)

The IEEE International Conference on Data Mining series (ICDM) has
established itself as the world's premier research conference in data
mining. It provides an international forum for presentation of
original research results, as well as exchange and dissemination of
innovative, practical development experiences. The conference covers
all aspects of data mining, including algorithms, software and
systems, and applications. ICDM draws researchers and application
developers from a wide range of data mining related areas such as
statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, databases and data
warehousing, data visualization, knowledge-based systems, and high
performance computing. By promoting novel, high quality research
findings, and innovative solutions to challenging data mining
problems, the conference seeks to continuously advance the
state-of-the-art in data mining.

Topics of Interest
******************

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Foundations, algorithms, models, and theory of data mining
* Machine learning and statistical methods for data mining
* Mining text, semi-structured, spatio-temporal, streaming, graph,
  web, multimedia data
* Data mining systems and platforms, their efficiency, scalability,
  and privacy
* Data mining in modeling, visualization, personalization, and
  recommendation
* Applications of data mining in all domains including social, web,
  bioinformatics, and finance

Submission Guidelines
*********************

Paper submissions should be limited to a maximum of ten (10) pages, in
the IEEE 2-column format (templates available at
http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html
),
including the bibliography and any possible appendices. Submissions
longer than 10 pages will be rejected without a review. All
submissions will be triple-blind reviewed by the Program Committee on
the basis of technical quality, relevance to data mining, originality,
significance, and clarity. Author names and affiliations must not
appear in the submissions, and bibliographic references must be
adjusted to preserve author anonymity. Accepted papers will be
published in the conference proceedings by the IEEE Computer Society
Press.

All manuscripts are submitted as full papers and are reviewed based on
their scientific merit. There is no separate abstract submission
step. There are no separate industrial, application, short paper or
poster tracks.

Manuscripts must be submitted electronically in online submission
system (https://wi-lab.com/cyberchair/2015/icdm15/cbc_index.php). We
do not accept email submissions.

Repeatability
*************

Every effort should be made to enable the code and the datasets (or
their closest publicly available equivalents) and all relevant
parameter specifications available to reviewers and readers so that
the results can be independently replicated. While we cannot expect
*every* dataset used to be made public, it is in the best interest of
the authors to make as many as possible available (in the worst case,
a sampled or an anonymized version). To retain anonymity of
submissions, any such additional material should be anonymized as
well, and be published on an anonymous website (such as DropBox). The
repeatability factor will play an important role in the reviewer's
assessment of the submission.

Best Paper Awards
*****************

Awards will be conferred at the conference on the authors of the best
research paper, the best application paper, and the best student
paper. A selected number of accepted papers will be invited for
possible inclusion, in an expanded and revised form, in the Knowledge
and Information Systems journal published by Springer-Verlag.

Attendance
**********

ICDM is forum for presenting and discussing current research in data
mining. Therefore, at least one author of an accepted paper must
complete a regular conference registration and present the paper in
the conference, in order for the paper to be included in the
proceedings and program.

to whom I am concern,

hello, I am writing this letter to ask information about transferring from
UCO to OU. I by the end of this spring semester I will archive 32 credit
hours with a GPA of 3.37. There is 2 major things that push me to transfer
to OU: It rank first in Oklahoma and give huge amount of scholarship to us
international students. the only thing that bother me is the fact of losing
some of my credit that can't be transferable to OU. I checked you Transfer
Equivalence page but i still not understand it result. i attached the
result of the Transfer Equivalence so that you can help me to well
understand if possible. I highlighted the classes i need to know if it is
transferable. thanks

sincerely,

Subject: [Cs] ICNC-FSKD 2015 2nd Round Submissions due 16 May: Submitting to
	IEEE Xplore/EI Compendex/ISI 2015/5/3 23:09:29 vcfr
Message-ID: <20150503230929450703@hnu.edu.cn>

Dear Colleague,
 
We cordially invite you to submit a paper to the upcoming 2015 11th International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC 2015) and 2015 12th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD 2015), to be jointly held from 15-17 August 2015 in Zhangjiajie, China. The deadline for the 2nd (final) round of submissions is 16 May 2015 (papers already submitted in the previous round should not be re-submitted and will receive review notifications on 15 April). Extended versions of selected best papers will appear in 3 SCI-index ICNC-FSKD special issues of Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems, International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence and International Journal of Parallel Programming.
 
Zhangjiajie is a city in the northwestern part of Hunan province. Nearby is the Wulingyuan Scenic Area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and an AAAAA (the highest class) scenic area in China. Towering sandstones mesas, dense forests, and deep ravines form the gorgeous and mysterious natural landscape. With many spectacularly-shaped stone pillars, hidden valleys, seas of cloud, majestic waterfalls, wandering streams, clear lakes, and limestone caves, Wulingyuan is a must-see in China. Avatar, James Cameron?s block-buster movie, did much of its filming in these beautiful mountains.  
 
As with the past ICNC-FSKD conferences, all papers in conference proceedings will be submitted to both EI Compendex and ISTP (ISI Proceedings), as well as IEEE Xplore (all previous ICNC-FSKD conferences from 2005 to 2013 have been indexed in Ei Compendex). Extended versions of selected best papers will appear in an ICNC-FSKD special issue of International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, a SCI-index journal. ICNC-FSKD 2015 is technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society (pending).
 
ICNC-FSKD is a premier international forum for scientists and researchers to present the state of the art of data mining and intelligent methods inspired from nature, particularly biological, linguistic, and physical systems, with applications to computers, circuits, systems, control, robotics, communications, and more. This is an exciting and emerging interdisciplinary area in which a wide range of theory and methodologies are being investigated and developed to tackle complex and challenging problems. The registration fee of US-D410 includes proceedings, lunches, dinners, banquet, coffee breaks, and all technical sessions.
 
To promote international participation of researchers from outside the country/region where the conference is held (i.e., China?s mainland), researchers outside of China?s mainland are encouraged to propose invited sessions. An honorarium of US-D400 will be enjoyed by the organizer(s) for each completed (with at least 6 registered papers) invited session. The first author of each paper in an invited session must not be affiliated with an organization in China?s mainland. "(Invited Paper)" may be added below the title of each paper in the invited sessions. Invited session organizers will solicit submissions, conduct reviews and recommend accept/reject decisions on the submitted papers. Invited session organizers will be able to set their own submission and review schedules, as long as a set of recommended papers is determined by 3 June 2015. Each invited session proposal should include: (1) the name, bio, and contact information of each organizer of the invited session; (2) the title and a short synopsis of the invited session. Please send your proposal to icnc-fskd at hnu.edu.cn
 
For more information, visit the conference web page:
 
   http://icnc-fskd.hnu.edu.cn/
 
If you have any questions after visiting the conference web page, please email the secretariat at icnc-fskd at hnu.edu.cn
 
Join us at this major event in beautiful Zhangjiajie !!!

that-


   - How early I should apply for the spring session?
   - How much the total program will cost me?
   - Is there any scholarship option which I can apply for?


Please let me know I will be waiting for the reply.

Thanks & Regards,
Versha Deota

My son, Andrew Lyons, took CS 2334 Section 10 in the spring of 2015. As of
this afternoon, his transcript is still showing this Course is in Progress
and he does not have a grade.
 
I am just following up, since I called about this on Friday, and was told to
check back today, if a grade had not posted. Andrew was travelling to an
internship and I was checking for him.
 
 
Thank you,

Hello,
We need hands-on science booths and recruitment booths for the fall Women in Science Conference which is targeted to middle-school and high school students.  Could you please forward this email to any clubs or groups in your department (faculty advisor and relevant student officer)?  Please note that the final registration date is August 31, so planning for hands on booth activities should probably be started this summer instead of the beginning of the fall semester.

Someone in your department may already have registered for a booth.  If so, thanks!

Kay Scheets


HOST A BOOTH
AT THE 2015 WOMEN IN SCIENCE CONFERENCE
DURING THE HANDS-ON SCIENCE & RECRUITMENT FAIR
Details about this terrific (free) outreach opportunity may be found below.
[cid:image001.jpg at 01D083FB.074B4DF0]

Additional Information:
There is no registration fee or booth charge--the event is free, but registration is required.  Default presentation space will include a covered/draped 6 ft. table and 2 chairs.  Additional tables/chairs may be requested at the time of registration.  A light breakfast and box lunch will be provided to all registered vendors/volunteers.
You will be reaching students and teachers from all across Oklahoma; approximately 800 participants from 60+ schools are anticipated.  We encourage organizations that plan to host traditional recruitment booths to consider including some sort of interactive, hands-on experience at their table to more fully engage students.  A brief 1-2 minute activity can be a terrific conversation starter!  Also, students get excited about freebies, so (if possible) plan to bring promotional materials, giveaways, etc., to further engage students.  These items should be distributed informally and directly to student from your booth throughout the day.
Follow these steps to secure your booth space and register your attendants:

1.    One person from your group should submit the Booth Registration Form (via the Booth Registration link below) on your organization's behalf.  The deadline to register a booth is Monday, Aug. 31 or when maximum capacity has been reached.

2.    If your organization will be sponsoring two separate booths (i.e. two hands-on science booths or hands-on science plus a recruitment booth), you only need to complete one online form to register both booths.

3.    Everyone who will be attending the conference in support of your booth must individually register via the Vendors/Volunteers<http://www.okepscor.org/calendar/2015wis> link at the very bottom of the conference Webpage at http://www.okepscor.org/calendar/2015wis by Tuesday, Sept. 1.  (You should plan to send a minimum of two people to the conference to host your booth and interact with students.)

Subject: [Cs] ICNC-FSKD 2015 Submission open until 28 June: Submitting to
	IEEE Xplore/EI Compendex/ISI 2015/5/26 0:49:29 klyvlhip
Message-ID: <20150526004929842076@hnu.edu.cn>

Dear Colleague,
 
We cordially invite you to submit a paper to the upcoming 2015 11th International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC 2015) and 2015 12th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD 2015), to be jointly held from 15-17 August 2015 in Zhangjiajie, China. Due to numerous requests, submission will remain open until 28 June 2015. Extended versions of selected best papers will appear in 3 SCI-index ICNC-FSKD special issues of Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems, International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence and International Journal of Parallel Programming.
 
Zhangjiajie is a city in the northwestern part of Hunan province. Nearby is the Wulingyuan Scenic Area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and an AAAAA (the highest class) scenic area in China. Towering sandstones mesas, dense forests, and deep ravines form the gorgeous and mysterious natural landscape. With many spectacularly-shaped stone pillars, hidden valleys, seas of cloud, majestic waterfalls, wandering streams, clear lakes, and limestone caves, Wulingyuan is a must-see in China. Avatar, James Cameron?s block-buster movie, did much of its filming in these beautiful mountains.  
 
As with the past ICNC-FSKD conferences, all papers in conference proceedings will be submitted to both EI Compendex and ISTP (ISI Proceedings), as well as IEEE Xplore (all previous ICNC-FSKD conferences from 2005 to 2013 have been indexed in Ei Compendex). Extended versions of selected best papers will appear in an ICNC-FSKD special issue of International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, a SCI-index journal. ICNC-FSKD 2015 is technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society (pending).
 
ICNC-FSKD is a premier international forum for scientists and researchers to present the state of the art of data mining and intelligent methods inspired from nature, particularly biological, linguistic, and physical systems, with applications to computers, circuits, systems, control, robotics, communications, and more. This is an exciting and emerging interdisciplinary area in which a wide range of theory and methodologies are being investigated and developed to tackle complex and challenging problems. The registration fee of US-D410 includes proceedings, lunches, dinners, banquet, coffee breaks, and all technical sessions.
 
To promote international participation of researchers from outside the country/region where the conference is held (i.e., China?s mainland), researchers outside of China?s mainland are encouraged to propose invited sessions. An honorarium of US-D400 will be enjoyed by the organizer(s) for each completed (with at least 6 registered papers) invited session. The first author of each paper in an invited session must not be affiliated with an organization in China?s mainland. "(Invited Paper)" may be added below the title of each paper in the invited sessions. Invited session organizers will solicit submissions, conduct reviews and recommend accept/reject decisions on the submitted papers. Invited session organizers will be able to set their own submission and review schedules, as long as a set of recommended papers is determined by 3 June 2015. Each invited session proposal should include: (1) the name, bio, and contact information of each organizer of the invited session; (2) the title and a short synopsis of the invited session. Please send your proposal to icnc-fskd at hnu.edu.cn
 
For more information, visit the conference web page:
 
   http://icnc-fskd.hnu.edu.cn/
 
If you have any questions after visiting the conference web page, please email the secretariat at icnc-fskd at hnu.edu.cn
 
Join us at this major event in beautiful Zhangjiajie !!!

My name is Todd Dorethy.  I recently moved to the Oklahoma City area to work at Tinker Air Force Base as a software developer.  My background is in electrical engineering (bachelor's) and computational science (master's).  While I am familiar with some computer science concepts, I would like to learn more.  I am interested in your non-thesis master's degree program.  Can you please advise what prerequisites would be required of me and if I could speak to someone and/or tour your facilities?
 
Thank you,
Todd Dorethy

-- 
Dear Beloved,

I am Mrs. Marissa Hansberger  from Z?rich, Switzerland, I am legally 
married to Mr. Philip Hansberger , a Ghana citizen born brought up in 
Switzerland, we live in Switzerland with my husband, before we move down 
to Ghana after my husband retirement, I am 48 years old by the grace of 
God

My dear  Last year I experience restlessness and sleepless nights so my 
Doctor in Zurich, Switzerland sent me on a general Medical Checkup which 
I was finally diagnosed to have cancer of the Lungs. So my Doctor flies 
me back to my country Switzerland. My late husband?s brother wanted me 
dead so that he will inherit all my wealth I suffered to build. As a 
Christian I rather donate my money to the less privilege, orphanage 
homes , than allow wicked people to take all when I die. Lately I 
discovered that my late husband?s relation know about the deposited 
money and they  are happy that I will soon die so that they can take the 
money, so I will give the claim information to you before I pass on to 
glory.

I will give you all the details that will assist you in getting the 
Funds deposited with the security Company. I deposited the total of 
US$8,500.000.00 (Eight million five hundred united states dollars) in 
cash in a sealed consignment Box in disguise as (Church Evangelical 
Materials/Family valuables). This means that the Security Company staffs 
does not know that the Consignment Box contains the cash to avoid 
Vitalization or theft until the given duration. I will send you the 
Claim documents (Deposit Certificate and Agreement Bond) and the contact 
information of the Security Company where the money is deposited in 
Disguise, I want to have an assurance from you that even when I die, you 
will not use the money wrongly and will do your best to get it from the 
security Company in Accra Ghana. I will die happily if I know you will 
use my funds in a manner pleasing to humanity when you get it.

I have to rest now due to my unusual weakness. Please pray for me my 
dear and respond urgently to my email so that I can be able to conclude 
the inheritance Hand over Authorization before I die. I anxiously await 
your response my dear.

May you be blessed, as you reach me E-mail:  mhonsberger at daum.net

Best Regards,

Marissa  Hansberger

Hello,

I'm in the Accelerated Degree program for CS, but I'm having trouble remembering the three classes that I had chosen to count for shared coursework.  Where would I be able to check which three classes I picked?

Thanks,

Subject: [Cs] 14108 - Enrollment, Departmental Permission
Message-ID: <6E50722D-DCA1-44B1-9CF1-E3CD0F8469F3@ou.edu>

Up until last semester, I was a Computer Science student. Due to academic goals, I changed my major to Multidisciplinary Studies. I am now a Mathematics/Computer Science MDS major. Because I am no longer enrolled as a Computer Science student, I will need a departmental override to enroll in Theory of Computation this fall. My degree plan, which has been approved by the provost, requires completion of this course. I meet all of the prerequisites and am hoping to enroll before the class fills up. This will be my last year at the University of Oklahoma, so completion is essential.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Cale Kennedy

Subject: [Cs] Updated guides to online learning in computer science
Message-ID: <35643646044722057412991@TheRealTMoney>

Hi there,

 

I?m hoping you can help me with a quick request. I noticed you list various computer science resources on the following page: http://www.cs.ou.edu/~hougen/

 

Our organization, Computer Science Online, recently updated our site with more comprehensive resources for students and professionals in computer science and other related fields. The site now includes a program search tool, in-depth guides on career paths in computer science, and an expert-driven guide to scholarships, education and careers for women in the field. I encourage you to check us out here: http://www.computerscienceonline.org/

 

Would it be possible for you to list us as a link reference on your website? Perhaps the page I mentioned above would be a good fit. 

 

We love feedback, too. Please don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email with any questions or comments. I really appreciate your time and look forward to hearing from you soon.

 

Thank you,

 

Angela Hanners

EDUCATIONAL ROBOTICS FOR ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS: The Basics of LEGO Robot Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Rowan University Laboratory for Educational Robotics (RULER Lab) invites you
 to join our free self-paced online courses that teach absolute beginners the fundamentals
of programming LEGO robots. Over 5,000 people have already participated in our LEGO
NXT Robotics Course and we are excited to announce that our new LEGO EV3 Robotics
Course is now open.  Both courses were designed specifically for K-12 teachers, 
but are free and open to anyone who is interested in learning about LEGO NXT robotics
thanks to the support of Google's CS4HS program.

The LEGO NXT and EV3 robots are programmed using block-based visual programming 
languages that (combined with the physicality of a robot and the familiarity that
many people have with LEGO) we hope will be attractive to people who are new to 
programming. Each lesson in these five week courses includes short video clips, 
self test questions, and robot projects. The first week does not require any special
hardware, but after week 1 you'll need a LEGO NXT or EV3 robot and software to complete
all the exercises.

To learn more about both of these courses, please visit http://www.rowan.edu/cs4hs
[http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001nTrGnuwusFNXXXUN3OvZ58g0v5Aom1M8nLlhKK69HjiYnym2UswUrXCweLba-y-nRgC7Rb0mEXM3m6DZWQA7r-7VjYZMOLZPDiX57C85y13AW5AhWmyGSoARP3RZrwchU_k23Rqu8GZVBQW9C17zAeYtzQx37KRYm0DP4EFZBH3qUUhX_bwQ1Q==&c=lBhnboq_VytzHzya0uY-CbHob4bJW-T2pDa6d2jig5oe9jtgpZCeJQ==&ch=zY1E1WTqm_fwbZpH9TPP2vyBEJFshu29P2TAlqMR9gApyPfmujfG9Q==].

K-12 Cyber Security Curriculum Info Gathering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are collecting and analyzing the current state of K-12 cyber security curriculum
as a task under the National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Security Agency's
(NSA) GenCyber program. If you have any cyber/computer security material in any 
of your school's courses (not limited to computer courses), we would appreciate 
any information you would be willing to provide about it. The material will be integrated
into a report for the NSF and NSA discussing the available curriculum, and areas
 needing expansion in the future.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am nakka Rasagna and i am currently living here in USA(Bartlesville, OK)
for the past 1.5 years on a dependent Visa(F2 and then H4). I have
completed my masters of technology in Computer science in India and worked
for a multinational company for 2 years(Tata Consultancy Services) as a
systems engineer. I am interested to pursue Masters degree(Computer
Science) program in University of Oklahoma and would request if you can
please guide me with some of the questions i have

1)  Is it too late for the graduate admissions for the FALL semester?? I
have all my transcripts, letters of recommendations ready with me.

2)   I have written the TOEFL last month and got a score of 79. My GRE is
scheduled this week(06/18). What is the average GRE recommended score for
the CS department?

I like the curriculum of the computer science department and an really
interested to join the university. Please let me know if i still have a
chance of getting an admit with the university.

Thank you and appreciate your time.

Thanks and Regards,
N Rasagna

New $10,000 Award for CS Students: ACM/CSTA Cutler-Bell Prize in High School Computing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dear CSTA Community,

CSTA is pleased to announce a new award aimed at recognizing talented high school
students in computer science. The ACM/CSTA Cutler-Bell Prize in High School Computing
seeks to promote and encourage the field of computer science, as well as to empower
young and aspiring learners to pursue computing challenges outside of the traditional
classroom environment.

Four winners will be selected annually and each will be awarded a $10,000 prize 
and cost of travel to the annual ACM/CSTA Cutler-Bell Prize in High School Computing
Reception where students will demonstrate their programs and discuss their work.
 The prizes will be funded by a $1 million endowment established by David Cutler
 and Gordon Bell.
Eligible applicants for the award will include graduating high school seniors residing
and attending school in the US. Challenges for the award will focus on developing
an artifact that engages modern computing technology and computer science. Judges
will look for submissions that demonstrate ingenuity, complexity, relevancy, originality,
and a desire to further computer science as a discipline.
The application period for the inaugural award [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001IspVe1wqos88nG8SXHeYdPTFgcH4iyT8IRkVMk0IFYHhyyL0wtgBKUhtEwWUJYLqbBdUPeRkNF3ibfDBJ1LZDC3Q4lQ-_Cnp2QFgyFEzloYN93mPM6VJeRx_8dSZCyUFoII2XN0_Rew3kvwwmFEOOjttQe3UajMECKkJw7mi8aX3xr3uKYEg5exDkiwFlLKfHLz-n7HDVyWfhU_THRGl2ZqMms5pKnbN_UW-3Q9pMOs=&c=B-CVuw8BfxvNwxUKH-096tebKjpvHigu-JH15MIBQFWbfAueSpNCtQ==&ch=2umqKgvNvhoz5gu2_xD1qfFk_ElaStukMmtKlPo_MSjD_z2JhVfQ_Q==]

Subject: [Cs] ICNC-FSKD 2015 Submission open until 28 June: Submitting to
	IEEE Xplore/EI Compendex/ISI 2015/6/21 2:04:44 uek
Message-ID: <20150621020444153056@hnu.edu.cn>

Dear Colleague,
 
We cordially invite you to submit a paper to the upcoming 2015 11th International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC 2015) and 2015 12th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD 2015), to be jointly held from 15-17 August 2015 in Zhangjiajie, China. Due to numerous requests, submission will remain open until 28 June 2015. Extended versions of selected best papers will appear in4 SCI-index ICNC-FSKD special issues of Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems, International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, Concurrency and Computation: Practice & Experience, and International Journal of Parallel Programming (65+ papers). 
 
Zhangjiajie is a city in the northwestern part of Hunan province. Nearby is the Wulingyuan Scenic Area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and an AAAAA (the highest class) scenic area in China. Towering sandstones mesas, dense forests, and deep ravines form the gorgeous and mysterious natural landscape. With many spectacularly-shaped stone pillars, hidden valleys, seas of cloud, majestic waterfalls, wandering streams, clear lakes, and limestone caves, Wulingyuan is a must-see in China. Avatar, James Cameron?s block-buster movie, did much of its filming in these beautiful mountains.  
 
As with the past ICNC-FSKD conferences, all papers in conference proceedings will be submitted to both EI Compendex and ISTP (ISI Proceedings), as well as IEEE Xplore (all previous ICNC-FSKD conferences from 2005 to 2013 have been indexed in Ei Compendex). Extended versions of selected best papers will appear in an ICNC-FSKD special issue of International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, a SCI-index journal. ICNC-FSKD 2015 is technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society (pending).
 
ICNC-FSKD is a premier international forum for scientists and researchers to present the state of the art of data mining and intelligent methods inspired from nature, particularly biological, linguistic, and physical systems, with applications to computers, circuits, systems, control, robotics, communications, and more. This is an exciting and emerging interdisciplinary area in which a wide range of theory and methodologies are being investigated and developed to tackle complex and challenging problems. The registration fee of US-D410 includes proceedings, lunches, dinners, banquet, coffee breaks, and all technical sessions.
 
To promote international participation of researchers from outside the country/region where the conference is held (i.e., China?s mainland), researchers outside of China?s mainland are encouraged to propose invited sessions. An honorarium of US-D400 will be enjoyed by the organizer(s) for each completed (with at least 6 registered papers) invited session. The first author of each paper in an invited session must not be affiliated with an organization in China?s mainland. "(Invited Paper)" may be added below the title of each paper in the invited sessions. Invited session organizers will solicit submissions, conduct reviews and recommend accept/reject decisions on the submitted papers. Invited session organizers will be able to set their own submission and review schedules, as long as a set of recommended papers is determined by 3 June 2015. Each invited session proposal should include: (1) the name, bio, and contact information of each organizer of the invited session; (2) the title and a short synopsis of the invited session. Please send your proposal to icnc-fskd at hnu.edu.cn
 
For more information, visit the conference web page:
 
   http://icnc-fskd.hnu.edu.cn/
 
If you have any questions after visiting the conference web page, please email the secretariat at icnc-fskd at hnu.edu.cn

Hi Team,

I have applied for Masters in Computer Science. My application is under
departmental review as per student portal.

I have a concern here , till now I have not received the final admission
result from the University and I am afraid as the time is going by I might
not get Visa dates as the the dates for Visa are getting re-scheduled due
to US visa database glitch happened recently. Due to this issue the dates
for Visa are getting blocked day by day in India.

So requesting you to please prioritize my application if possible.
And also could you please provide an estimated time of my application final
decision.

Please help me!

Thank You!

Regards,
Priyanka Kaul

Hi Team,

I have applied for Masters in Computer Science. My application is under
departmental review as per student portal.

I have a concern here , till now I have not received the final admission
result from the University and I am afraid as the time is going by I might
not get Visa dates as the the dates for Visa are getting re-scheduled due
to US visa database glitch happened recently. Due to this issue the dates
for Visa are getting blocked day by day in India.

So requesting you to please prioritize my application if possible.
And also could you please provide an estimated time of my application final
decision.

Please help me!

Thank You!

Regards,
Priyanka Kaul

I would like to know more information on appealing a class or requesting a withdrawal/drop from the class if there are sufficient reasons. I was told I could attempt to schedule a meeting with the dean possibly. Any information or feedback on this process would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Good Morning,

Hope all is well. I'm reaching out to let you know about an exciting new program, the SANS CyberTalent Immersion Academy sponsored by Solutionary Inc. This Academy is an intensive, accelerated training program that provides SANS world-class training and GIAC certifications to quickly and effectively launch careers with Solutionary in cybersecurity.

I'm writing because SANS and Solutionary (a NTT group security company based in Omaha, NE) are seeking high performing, distinguished students in the region that have recently graduated and are looking for employment in cybersecurity. The Academy provides a unique opportunity for them to not only receive high-quality SANS training and GIAC certs, but do so in a way that leads directly to a job with a great regional employer. Will you pass information (collateral materials attached) on to your graduating and recently graduated students about this opportunity?

The period of applications is open NOW until July 27, and enrollment in the Academy will begin on August 3. Please instruct students to contact Raedawn Johnson at RaedawnJohnson at solutionary.com to apply and visit https://www.sans.org/cybertalent/immersion-academy/programs for more information. Please note - while the Academy was launched for transitioning veterans, we are expanding it to accept applications from high-performing students demonstrating excellence in cybersecurity.

Best,

Max Shuftan

Computer Science Department:

I am interested in pursuing a degree with your program as a second-career student.  I currently hold a B.S. In Accounting from Ohio State University, a Master in Accounting from Ohio State University, and a Master in Divinity from Saint Paul School of Theology.  Can you please advise me on what the educational path might look like for me? Is it better to take a few classes as a non-degree student and then apply for a Master in Computer Science, or is there a shortened undergraduate degree program for students who already have a Bachelor degree from another institution?

I look forward to your response.

Thank you,
Chris

My Dear,

It is my pleasure to contact you for a business venture which I intend to establish in your country. Though I have not met with you before but I believe one has to risk confidence to succeed sometimes in life. There is this huge amount of ($7.5Million U.S dollars) which my late Father kept with a Fiduciary Fund Holder in Abidjan before his death Now, I have decided to invest this money in your country or anywhere safe enough outside Africa for security and political reasons. I want you to assist me claim and retrieve this fund from the Fiduciary Fund Holders and transfer it into your personal account in your country for investment purposes on these areas:

1).Telecommunication 
2).The transport industry
3). Five star hotel.

I await your soonest response.
Respectfully
 yours,
Miss Lucy Benson

Greetings 

I'm contacting
 you based on your good profiles I read and for a good reasons, I am in 
search of a property to buy in your country as I intended to come over 
to your 
country for investment, Though I have not met with you 
before but I believe that one has to risk confiding in someone to 
succeed sometimes in life.

My name is Mrs Achan Zaza .My late 
husband deals on Crude Oil with Federal Government of Sudan and he has a
 personal Oil firm in Bentiu Oil zone town and Upper 
Nile city. What
 I have experience physically, I don't wish to experience it again in my
 life due to the recent civil Ethnic war cause by our President Mr. 
Salva Kiir 
and the rebel leader Mr Riek Machar, I have been Under 
United Nation refuge camp in chad to save my life and that of my little 
daughter.

Though, I do not know how you will feel to my proposal,
 but the truth is that I sneeked into Chad our neighbouring country 
where I am living now as a refugee.
?I escaped with my little 
daughter when the rebels bust into our house on 21/04/2014 and? killed 
my husband as one of the big oil dealers in the country, ever since 
then, I have being on the run.

?I left my country and move to 
Chad our neighbouring country with the little ceasefire we had, due to 
the face to face peace meeting accord coordinated by the US Secretary of
 State, Mr John Kerry and United Nations in Ethiopia (Addis Ababa) 
between our President Mr Salva Kiir and the rebel leader Mr Riek Machar 
to stop this war.

I want to solicit for your partnership with 
trust to invest the? $8 million dollars deposited by my late husband 
because my life is no longer safe in our coutry, since the rebels are 
looking for the families of all the oil business men in the country to 
kill, saying that they are they one that is milking the country dry.

I will offer you 20% of the total fund for your help while I will partner with you for the investment in your country.

I will wait to hear from you so as to give you details.

With love from
Mrs. Achan

Hi I'm emailing about my special permission to take the Intro to Programming course (ID 33500). I  received an email about being granted the permission from Professor Trytten today. The issue I"m having is that Mrs. Perez the managerial associate at the C S department hasn't filed the permission. I was wanting to know if this will be done soon so that I can enroll into the course? Please email me back as soon as you can.

Subject: [Cs] Regarding Application Fee Waiver
Message-ID: <CAP1MCt8U24w9K015o9uhXrM8X4B_eARbyrj4ySLRCug1L2gf0w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a student from India looking for graduate program (Spring 2016) in
computer science in your university. I have cleared my GRE exam with a
score of 309/340 (Quant 159, Verbal 150, AWA 3.0) and TOEFL exam with a
score of 90. With a CGPA of 8.51 in undergraduate, I have been amongst top
4 students of my college.  I completed my under-graduation in June 2014.
Since then I worked as a lab instructor with Indore based IT company
Universal Informatics. And currently working with YPSILON Development Pvt.
Ltd. as a software developer in developing Web and Enterprise Applications
using Technologies Java/J2EE, Spring, Struts and Hibernate.


I come from a lower middle income Indian family. Seeing my consistent
performance, dedication, hard-work and considering financial state of my
family, my company YPSILON Development Pvt. Ltd. sponsored my GRE and TOEFL
exams.


I am very passionate to pursue masters in computer science from your
esteemed university but considering financial circumstances of my family,
it?s a tough decision for me. In past some of my seniors who have been
admitted to US universities got application fee waiver. Last fall, I
applied to few universities in US but unfortunately due to some unforeseen
circumstances, I was not able to join them. Due to hefty expense on
application process last year, I am facing paucity of finance to continue
application for spring session 2016. I would be grateful if I could get an
application fee waiver to apply for spring session. This would not only
help me to alleviate my family?s financial burden but will also help me
achieve my long term dream of pursuing masters program from your esteemed
university.


Also, I would like to know about merit based scholarship opportunities
being offered in your university. I have been a diligent student in all my
academic pursuits so considering my current score and academic profile, Do
you think I stand fair chances for scholarships? I understand that
admission committee follows a complete process to make such decisions but a
harbinger on final decision would help me to judiciously apply in such
financial  circumstances. Sorry to inundate you with so many queries here.


I appreciate you taking out time to consider my appeal. Looking forward to
your reply.


Warm Regards,

Mansi Sogani

Dear whom may it concerned,

I am Thuc Duong, a student at OU and currently taking CS as my major. I have a little question about the enrollment for the fall semester. I want to enroll for 2 classes: CS2334 and CS2603 but I can not because they require CS1323 as the prerequisite. However, I am taking CS1323 this summer but will not finish until the end of July. So is there any chance that I can enroll CS2334 and CS2603 in advance because available places in those 2 classes are running out pretty fast.

I really appreciate your help and look forward to your reply.

Best regard,
Thuc Duong.

Hello, I was thinking about transferring to OU from Penn
State. And on the transferring credits database, a large majority of my credits
either don't exist in the database itself, or they are not counted (even though
the courses are most likely identical) so I was wondering if you could help me
figure out if all or any of my credits will transfer into the OU Computer
Science Major. Thanks for your time and
consideration. 


Here is my unofficial resume also
dont' look at the GPA as I took 12 of the hardest credits PSU has to offer last
year while pledging and it tanked my GPA. just assume it is around a
3.2

Happy Wednesday!

I apologize for not knowing who this needs question needs to be directed to. We've been communicating with Tariq through a recent Continuous Enrollment Outreach effort. He is a recipient of a need-based Retention Award and has indicated that he hasn't been advised for Fall 2015. He does plan to enroll and his Bursar Registration Hold has been resolved. Would you be able to help me identify a plan to get him advised for the Fall? Who does he need to contact?

Thank you in advance for your help!
